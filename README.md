# Machine Learning Introduction

Jupyter notebooks for teaching machine learning. Based on scikit-learn, with OpenML used to experiment more extensively on many datasets.

## Sources
We use many code examples from the following excellent book. We urge you to read it for a more complete coverage of machine learning in Python:

"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by [Andreas Mueller](http://amueller.io) and [Sarah Guido](https://twitter.com/sarah_guido). You can find details about the book on the [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do>). We'll be using the included mglearn package to make plotting easier.

Additional code examples originate from the following books (again, warmly recommended):
