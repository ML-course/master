Actually the company, and the product was ROVAC - which stood for
ROTary Air Conditioning..it used a rotary compressor with what
was effectively an air/air heat exchanger, and worked pretty well.
The negatives were mostly that it was about 5-10% less efficient than
using freon, and noise problems from the high velocity/pressure air,
all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt.  It
is still a legal entity in Florida, but I believe completely "dead"..
and there's a heck of an opurtunity to buy up it's patents and restart
the operation...

It's odd how as I get older, the days are longer, but the years are shorter!
