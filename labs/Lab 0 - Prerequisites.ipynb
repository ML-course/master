    "## Python\n",
    "You first need to set up a Python environment (if you do not have done so already). The easiest way to do this is by installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which will install Python as well as a set of commonly used packages. We will be using Python 3, so be sure to install the right version. Always install a 64-bit installer (if your machine supports it), and we recommend using Python 3.10 or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are completely new to Python, we recommend reading the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) or taking an introductory online course, such as the [Definite Guide to Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming), the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython), or [this Python Course](https://www.python-course.eu/).

    "**Windows users**: If you are new to Anaconda, read the [starting guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/). You'll probably use the Anaconda Prompt to run any commands or to start Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mac users**: You'll probably use your terminal to run any commands or to start Jupyter Lab. Make sure that you have Command Line tools installed. If not, run ``xcode-select --install``. You won't need a full XCode installation. \n",

However, installing the latest version of tensorflow-macos doesn't always work reliably and you may have to downgrade to an older version.\n",
